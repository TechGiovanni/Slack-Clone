# slack-page-clone

This page was created using different css files to organize components, implemented bootstrap for the input field and everything else was 
implemented using margins, flexbox, font awesome for the icons and documentation.

Used borders around boxes throught the creation process to get a sense of the box's width and height, 
then commented them out after finish working on that specific component just incase revisiting the.
